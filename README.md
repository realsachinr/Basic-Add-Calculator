This code implements a basic addition calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of:

HTML structure with two input boxes for entering numbers, a button to trigger the calculation, and a div to display the result.

CSS styling to center align the calculator, style the input boxes, button, and result display.

JavaScript functionality to calculate the sum of the numbers entered into the input boxes when the button is clicked. It retrieves the values entered in the input boxes, converts them to numbers, performs the addition operation, and then displays the result in the designated result div.
